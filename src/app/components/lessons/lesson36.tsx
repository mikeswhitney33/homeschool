                    Lily is helping her dad in his woodworking shop.
                    Her dad gives her a 12-inch ruler, a yardstick, and a measuring
                    tape. These are all tools that help measure length.
                </P>
                <P>
                    Look at the ruler on this page. It is the actual length of a 12-inch
                    ruler. Do you see how each of the 12 inches is marked with a
                    number? The longer tick mark between two numbers is the
                    half-inch mark.  point to the half-inch mark between 2 and 3.
                    Lily&apos;s dad asks Lily to find a 1-inch nail. To
                    measure an item in inches with a ruler, you place the
                    ruler&apos;s edge (or the number 0 if it includes it) at one
                    end of the item. Then you see where the other
                    end of the item lands on the ruler. What is
                    the length of each
                    nail?

                    There are 12 inches in a foot. Do you think a spoon would be
                    more or less than a foot? Do you think you are more or less than one foot tall?
                    What about a mouse? Can you think of an animal that would be longer than a
                    foot? The average baby is 20 inches when he or she is born. Is the average baby
                    more or less than one foot when he or she is born?

                    A yard is 36 inches long, which is three feetâ€”about the length of a guitar. A
                    yardstick measures one yard. A yardstick is the length of three 12-inch
                    rulers put together. If you are measuring something that is 6
                    feet long, would it be faster to use a ruler or a yardstick?
                    It makes sense to measure longer distances
                    with yards. For example, people in the US usually
                    measure football fields in yards. A football field
                    is 100 yards long.

                    Measuring tapes have varying
                    lengths, but many are at least
                    60 inches long.
